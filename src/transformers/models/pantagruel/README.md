This folder contains codebase for loading and using the speech-only and text-only pre-trained models, which are based on [data2vec 2.0 architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07525). The pre-trained models were trained using `fairseq` 0.12.2 library and converted to HuggingFacce's `transformers`. It is recommended to use them with the following versions : `transformers==4.57.0` or `4.56.2`, `tokenizers==0.22.1`, and `sentencepiece==0.1.99`.
